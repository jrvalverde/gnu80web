C
C                conventions for orienting molecules in cartesian space
C
C
C
C  a.  goals
C
C           1.  the molecule is oriented  so  as  to  simplify  the  3x3
C               transformation matrices.
C
C           2.  two z-matrices differing  only  in  the  values  of  the
C               internal  coordinates but which are identical as regards
C               the integer quantites  (such  as  occurs  on  subsequent
C               points  of  a  geometry  optimization) shall produce the
C               same orientation of the molecule.
C
C           3.  two different z-matrices for  the  same  molecule  shall
C               produce  the  same  coordinates,  save  for  a  possible
C               renumbering of the atoms.
C
C           4.  the number of molecular  orbital  coefficients  zero  by
C               symmetry should be maximized.
C
C  b.  general considerations
C
C           1.  a  right  handed  coordinate   system   will   be   used
C               throughout.
C
C           2.  the molecule will be translated so that  its  center  of
C               charge is at the origin.
C
C           3.  atoms will not be reordered relative to their order upon
C               input.
C
C           4.  the cartesian axes will be  considered  to  increase  in
C               priority in the order x < y < z.
C
C  c.  rules for the positioning of an axis
C
C           1.  an axis of rotation or a principal axis of charge may be
C               aligned with a cartesian axis in one of two ways.  which
C               way  will  be  decided  by  successively  applying   the
C               following tests until a definitive result is achieved:
C               1.  the third moment of charge should be positive.
C               2.  the sum of the projections of the atomic coordinates
C                   onto the reference axis should be positive.
C               3.  the first atom with a  non-zero  projection  on  the
C                   reference  axis should have a positive projection on
C                   that axis.
C
C           2.  if a rotation is neccessary in order to meet one of  the
C               above  criteria  it shall be a 180 degree rotation about
C               the axis defined below:
C                          reference         axis
C                            axis         of rotation
C
C                             x                y
C                             y                z
C                             z                x
C
C  d.  rules for  postioning  the  principal  axes  of  charge:  in  the
C      abscence  of any other rules, the principal axis corresponding to
C      the largest principal moment of charge will be aligned  with  the
C      highest priority cartesian axis available.
C
C  e.  special rules for asymmetric top molecules
C
C           1.  cs:  the molecular plane shall be made  coincident  with
C               the  xy plane.  note that this convention conflicts with
C               mulliken's suggestion, but that it  is  consistent  with
C               the  character  tables  of  cotton and of herzberg.  the
C               moleule is then rotated about the z-axis  in  accordance
C               with the rules given below for cn molecules.
C
C           2.  c2v:  following mulliken's recommendation for planar c2v
C               molecules,  the  molecular  plane  is  placed  in the yz
C               plane.  for non-planar molecules the following tests are
C               successively applied:
C               1.  the mirror plane with the most atoms is put  in  the
C                   yz plane.
C               2.  the mirror plane with the most non-hydrogen atoms is
C                   put in the yz plane.
C               3.  the mirror plane with the lowest  numbered  atom  is
C                   made coincident with yz.
C               4.  apply axes of charge rules as per section d.
C
C           3.  planar     d2h     molecules:  following      mulliken's
C               recommendation,  the molecular plane is placed in the yz
C               plane.  the molecule is rotated about the x axis so that
C               the  z  axis  shall  pass  through the greater number of
C               atoms, or, if this is not decisive, the  greater  number
C               of bonds.
C
C           4.  c2 molecules follow the general rules given below for cn
C               molecules.
C
C           5.  c1 molecules are not re-oriented.
C
C           6.  ci molecules are translated but not rotated.
C
C  f.  special rules for symmetric top molecules
C
C           1.  the unique axis is aligned with the z axis.
C
C           2.  definition:  a "circular-set" of atoms  is  composed  of
C               those  atoms lying in a plane which have the same atomic
C               number and which are equidistant from a  reference  axis
C               perpindicular to the plane.  atoms on the reference axis
C               are not included in any circular-sets.   a  circular-set
C               of atoms is generated by a proper rotation axis.
C
C           3.  definition:  the "key-atom" in a symmetric top  molecule
C               is  the  lowest  numbered  atom in the key circular-set.
C               the following tests are carried out successively to find
C               the key circular-set:
C               1.  which set is nearest the xy plane
C               2.  which set has a positive projection on the z axis
C               3.  which set is nearest to the z axis
C               4.  which set is comprised  of  atoms  with  the  lowest
C                   atomic number
C
C           4.  cn, cnh, sn:  the molecule is rotated about  the  z-axis
C               so  as  to  maximize  the number of pairs of heavy atoms
C               which  are  parallel  to  the  y  axis.   if   no   such
C               arrangement  is satisfactory then the key atom is placed
C               in  the  yz  plane  so  as  to  give  it  a  positive  y
C               coordinate.
C
C           5.  dn, dnh:  one of the c2 axes is made coincident with the
C               y  cartesian  axis.   the  tests  in 7 below are used to
C               decide which c2 axis is so positioned.
C
C           6.  dnd, cnv:  one of the vertical planes is made coincident
C               with  the  yz cartesian plane.  the tests in 7 below are
C               used to decide which plane is so positioned.
C
C           7.  test for orienting dn, dnh, dnd, and cnv molecules:
C               1.  maximize the projection of the key  atom  on  the  y
C                   axis/
C               2.  if two orientations give the maximum projection on y
C                   choose the one with the maximum projection on x.
C
C           8.  for molecules contained in the  xy  plane  the  standard
C               axis orientation rule (see section c) are applied to the
C               x axis to complete the  specification  of  a  molecule's
C               orientation.
C
C  g.  special rules for spherical top molecules
C
C           1.  definitions:  a "spherical-set" of atoms is composed  of
C               those  atoms  which  are equidistant from the origin and
C               which have the same atomic number.  spherical-sets shall
C               be  ordered  in  terms  of  increasing distance from the
C               origin and in terms of increasing atomic number  at  any
C               one  distance.   the  "key  atom" is the lowest numbered
C               atom in the first spherical-set.
C
C           2.  t, td, th
C               1.  align the three c2 axes with the cartesian  axes  so
C                   as to maximize the z-coordinate of the key atom.
C               2.  treat the molecule as a symmetric top.
C
C           3.  o, oh
C               1.  align the three c4 axes with the cartesian  axes  so
C                   as to maximize the z-coordinate of the key atom.
C               2.  treat the molecule as a symmetric top.
C
C           4.  i, ih
C               1.  align one of the c5 axes with the z axis  so  as  to
C                   maximize the z-coordinate of the key atom.
C               2.  treat the molecule as a symmetric top.
