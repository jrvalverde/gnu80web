\section*{{\tt DIRECT} SCF in gnu80}
It is now possible to perform (closed-shell) SCF calculations
in {\tt gnu80} in which the electron-repulsion integrals are
computed as they are needed ({\em i.e.} not stored on an external file).
This is DIRECT SCF in the usual terminology. One simply adds the command 
``{\tt DIRECT}" to the command record, {\em e.g.}:
\begin{verbatim}
    %RWF=test.rwf
    # HF/6-31G*,DIRECT,OPT

       This is a sample DIRECT SCF Job

    0 1
    Z-Matrix RECORDS
    .
    .

\end{verbatim}
At the present time open-shell SCF(s) are not available in the DIRECT
form; they will appear in due course.

Equally, post-SCF jobs will crash because the repulsion integral file
will not be present.
The post-SCF (closed-shell) will be implemented before the open-shell
SCF.
